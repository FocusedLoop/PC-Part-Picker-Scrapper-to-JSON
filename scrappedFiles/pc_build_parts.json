            "Built the quietest gaming PC with an AMD Ryzen 5 9600X + RTX 4080 SUPER in collaboration with ASUS and Noctua on the #PCBuild channel #VladPCBuild.\nHey there, friends! I\u2019ve finally completed the branded build in collaboration with ASUS and Noctua. It didn\u2019t turn out exactly how I planned since some parts weren\u2019t available, but as usual, it ended up even better! We\u2019ve got ourselves a sleek, perfectly quiet gaming PC.\nThe main goal of this build was to test the combo of the Ryzen 5 9600X processor and the ASUS GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER ProArt OC graphics card. I also went out of my way to find some cool, interesting new components to make this silent PC truly stand out.\nThe foundation of the build is ASUS's new ProArt X870E-Creator WiFi motherboard, paired with the ProArt GPU. For RAM, I\u2019m using a new non-binary kit with 48GB of DDR5 memory \u2014 that\u2019s a 2x24GB/6400 Patriot Viper Xtreme 5 kit (model PVX548G64C32K). To complement the memory, I grabbed a super reliable and stable 4TB M.2 SSD from the same brand \u2014 the Patriot Viper VP4300 Lite (model VP4300L4TBM28H).\nFor cooling, I\u2019m using the next-gen legend \u2014 the Noctua NH-D15 G2 super air tower. To keep everything in one unified style and set up optimal airflow, I\u2019ve added 9 ultra-quiet Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM fans.\nPowering this whole setup is a solid choice in both price and performance \u2014 the Zalman Teramax 2 1000W (ZM1000-TMX2) power supply. And we\u2019re putting it all together in what I think is the best value-for-money case on the market \u2014 the Zalman Z10.\nAs always, I\u2019ll unbox and review all the components, walk you through how to properly assemble a gaming PC, and share some insights along the way. We\u2019ll also be testing it in three resolutions on the most demanding games we all play daily.\nIt\u2019s going to be as interesting and informative as ever, so I highly recommend watching till the end. Thanks for tuning in!",

            "AMD Ryzen 5 7600X (AM5); paired with Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE, Gigabyte Radeon RX 7800 XT (16GB VRAM), G.Skill 32GB DDR5-6000 RAM (2x16), 2TB WD NVMe, all inside an MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WIFI board and Lian Li Lancool 207.",
            "The Lian Li case had little room in the back, so the power cables were a tight fit, and the be quiet! modular PSU came with near egregiously short cables (CPU ones in particular) but they just about fit this ATX mid tower. The ARGB CPU fans had nasty cables imo; they are short, and the ARGB daisy chain takes some space so all I could do was slap them against the top of the case for now. :/",
            "The case also has lots of mesh and (4) intake fans out of the box. My PSU fan points downwards as to draw more air from below and the case exhausts to the rear and top. This build put me back ~$1280 with holiday deals. That is also before any new monitor or accessories.",

            "These are the top 4 things I love about Core Ultra 9 285K:",
            "Runs Super Cool (delid not necessary at all) - 14KS is a hot head, even direct-die on water it doesn't take much to get temps agitated. 285K on the other hand is cool as can be. My rig is literally 99% silent under operation because it consumes a lot less power which translates to nice cool temps. Even during max 4K gaming or full production tasks, my fans/pumps RARELY ramp up. I love it and it's hands-down one of my favorite things about Arrow Lake. Take a peek at the core temps and power draw in my screenshots. With the same hardware and 4K settings, my direct-die cooled 14KS core temps were 20c-30c higher.",
            "Far Lower Power Consumption Than Previous Gen - I'm not a stickler about power, but as mentioned above, the difference is very significant. With 285K I can play the same games I played with 14KS using half the amount of power and side by side I can't tell a difference in gameplay.  You can use just about any cooler you want for this thing and that opens up the door for a lot of options.",
            "CUDIMM Memory At 9000MHz Boots on XMP 2 With Zero Tuning! (***2 Dimms) - I haven't gotten heavy into overclocking ram yet and with CUDIMM on Z890 it looks like I'll never have to because every 8800Mhz kit I've tried can boot 9000Mhz+ XMP 2, with no tuning on this 4 dimm board. I was able to boot 9100MHz, but it wasn't stable, but with zero tuning it's still impressive. I definitely couldn't boot 9000MHz on XMP 2 with my 14KS. I daily drive now with stock XMP 2 settings @ 8800Mhz.",

            "These are the top 4 things I love about Core Ultra 9 285K:",
            "Runs Super Cool (delid not necessary at all) - 14KS is a hot head, even direct-die on water it doesn't take much to get temps agitated. 285K on the other hand is cool as can be. My rig is literally 99% silent under operation because it consumes a lot less power which translates to nice cool temps. Even during max 4K gaming or full production tasks, my fans/pumps RARELY ramp up. I love it and it's hands-down one of my favorite things about Arrow Lake. Take a peek at the core temps and power draw in my screenshots. With the same hardware and 4K settings, my direct-die cooled 14KS core temps were 20c-30c higher.",
            "Far Lower Power Consumption Than Previous Gen - I'm not a stickler about power, but as mentioned above, the difference is very significant. With 285K I can play the same games I played with 14KS using half the amount of power and side by side I can't tell a difference in gameplay.  You can use just about any cooler you want for this thing and that opens up the door for a lot of options.",
            "CUDIMM Memory At 9000MHz Boots on XMP 2 With Zero Tuning! (***2 Dimms) - I haven't gotten heavy into overclocking ram yet and with CUDIMM on Z890 it looks like I'll never have to because every 8800Mhz kit I've tried can boot 9000Mhz+ XMP 2, with no tuning on this 4 dimm board. I was able to boot 9100MHz, but it wasn't stable, but with zero tuning it's still impressive. I definitely couldn't boot 9000MHz on XMP 2 with my 14KS. I daily drive now with stock XMP 2 settings @ 8800Mhz.",

So a couple of weeks later after buying some finishing touches like getting a sleeved cable kit, a diffused RGB strip, and fans that were better performing than before. Much of the increase in performance has been the cpu which was underperforming due to a bad mount of the cooler that wasn't super obvious until I remounted it now it scored very will in cinebench r23 now getting 14,000 vs the 12,000 I was getting before. I get 16,000 in 3dmark time spy if anyone wants that information."

            "Started planning the build over the summer and waited for good deals/bundles to buy. I got the CPU,MOBO,RAM, and SSD from a Newegg bundle, which saved me about $118. Only caveat being that I run the RAM at 6000MHz due to constraints w/ the CPU voltage. I could bump it up a few hundred, but after dealing with a faulty/unstable system for a few years I value stability (plus its not a big difference and still performs great). Overall I spent just over $1200, and I am stoked. I plan on making a benchmark video for fun to showcase. \nThis is the first computer I built, so checking compatibility and assembling it was a bit intimidating but not too bad. Dealing with drivers/windows was annoying. Dont look at the cable managment...",

Finding the correct user manual online was necessary while installing due to some unclear instructions on where to plug some things in (mainly front panel power). Q-Flash was easy and the bios menu is very navigable. Very glad I chose it.",
            "SSD: Fast and easy. Not sure what else to say",
            "GPU: Very cool and quiet! looks great and performs amazing. Nothing can beat its price to performance. Microcenter deal for ~$450 made it even better.",
            "Case: I really like this case and waited a few months for it to go on sale again to buy. Attention to detail is obvious and it looks great. I am currently using the stock intake fans and they seem to get the job done. May switch out in the future. Pretty easy to build in and assemble. Not too big either. Includes a bunch of accessories for management.",

            "Hi there! This is my first PC ever and I built it all by myself, starting with having almost no knowledge on PC building. I'm really satisfied with the results and am confident to say that I'm fairly knowledgeable on PC building now. I cherry-picked each individual parts by myself after watching 48+ hours worth of Youtube videos and 50+ reddit posts within the timespan of 1.5 months. This is probably overkill but I really enjoyed the process and just wanted to make sure that each PC part is exactly what I want. On a side note though, some of the accessories I have were gifts I got from my friends but for the main PC parts, I bought them during Black Friday sales, which saved me a decent amount. The PC building process itself took me around 1 week to complete and this is because I have a pretty severe OCD, I must admit. That said, I'm happy to share the PC I've assembled this year. Would love to hear feedback for any improvements or suggestions. Thanks for stopping by!",

            "This is my upgrade from a 2020 TUF Gaming F15 laptop (i5 10300H [4C/8T] + 1650 Ti [4GB]). I'll add more images later. I only grabbed one to send to my friends. Doesn't show the outside, including the HDD hidden next to the PSU.",
            "The main features of this PC are:\n - i7 10700K [8C/16T]\n - 3070 FE [8GB]\n - 32GB Vengence LPX memory (DDR4, XMP for 3200MHz)\n - 5TB total storage (2TB Samsung NVMe (boot) / 2TB Crucial NVMe \"cold\" storage / 1TB HDD \"super cold\" storage)\n - ASRock B560 PRO4\n - Fractal North mid-tower case (because I'm basic like that)",
            "The motherboard has 3 NVMe slots, but only 2 of them can be used because of the 10th gen CPU. I'll be upgrading to an 11th gen CPU sometime next year, and will get that third NVMe.",
            "Most importantly: This PC cost me $700, only because I bought the GPU, CPU, and motherboard second-hand. The GPU was $333.95, and the CPU and motherboard came together for $217.67 (an epic steal considering how much of an upgrade it is for me). The PSU and case fans were all stolen, with the exception of the front case fans, which came with the case.",
            "I built this PC on the 23rd of November, which was built into another case that I borrowed from my local school. Then I bought the Fractal North on the 24th and transplanted all the internals today. The case arrived yesterday (December 11th).",
            "I haven't played many AAA titles other than Halo Infinite. I'm also playing the Master Chief collection (I found it for $10). Dicking around with the Nvidia settings showed me a \"Fast VSync\" setting, which was not available with my 1650 Ti. This lets me get more than 60 FPS because I'm using cheap monitors with only a 60Hz refresh rate (1080p), so I'd get horrific screen tearing without VSync. This prevents screen tearing.\nAll Halo games prior to Halo Infinite were running with lows of ~180 FPS and highs of ~600 FPS (anniversary editions would get ~200 FPS).\nSubnautica Below Zero also ran with high settings at ~190 FPS.\nFortnite (at least the festival game mode) runs with RTX set to high out of ultra at 80-120 FPS.",
            "Overall, this PC is amazing for me. Love it and do not regret switching to it at all, even if it drained my account."

            "I bought the 14900K as a place holder for something better, but my Best buy doesnt carry any X3d(and I am not a big AMD fan, for personal reasons)  and the ultra 9 was a tad outside my preferred budget.",
            "Both my 13700k and 14900K were not able to run my ram at full speed.  This time I have no issues with XMP.",
            "My monitor is the LG C3 but I cant list it, so I listed the monitor I use when I choose to use this as a tv.",
            "I did repo my gpu out of my old pc, but I will return it once the RTX 5090 is released.  Not doing 5080 as it has same ram amount and I find that a bit meh.  I want more.  Not the same :)",
            "CPU temps are anywhere from 30 to 36 on idle(depends when the heat kicks in on the room)\nand it hit 83c on OCCT test.  Gaming doesnt seem to go over 65c at all, in 4k or 1080p.",
            "I think my 14900K was a lemon, because it was so sluggish, even my rma 13700k was faster.  But this cpu is fast and cool.  My AIO is over kill but I havent used air in nearly 15 years, why start now?  I am testing the pre applied thermal paste, but I bought MX 4 to later swap to.  I may or may not swap the case non rgb fans to rgb, really depends on my mood.",
            "As for the Z890-F  The difference between E and F is the F has 2 less NVME, 5 instead of 7 and 2 less usbs(I think I have like 10? (too tired to go check) and there is no LCD Qcode on the mobo)  Otherwise it is identical for 100 bucks less.",
            "I know people are saying dont buy Arrow lake, but this is no Arrow to the Knee.  And I am enjoying this adventure!!  I legit have no regrets and I was honestly concerned I might.",
            "Most issues people had with games and drivers are windows related.  I did have to reinstall windows with 24h2 update be older windows has issues with EAC and other software and older windows makes you install via onboard gpu that I have yet to test(I turned mine off)",
            "My cpu seems to like to use 4.6GHhz has the standard but will boost to 5.2 as needed I havent overclocked yet as I have no need to.",
            "The OCCT photo isnt even optimized as I have a half dozen tabs open, icue, msi afterburner steam and a few other things I normally close before running.",
            "Not sure why all the outcry.  This was $200 cheaper than me going with a 9800x3d and at 4k I am gpu bound anyway, so I wouldnt likely see any performance gain or loss between the 2.",
