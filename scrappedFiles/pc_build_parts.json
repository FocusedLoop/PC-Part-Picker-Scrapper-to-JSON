            "Built the quietest gaming PC with an AMD Ryzen 5 9600X + RTX 4080 SUPER in collaboration with ASUS and Noctua on the #PCBuild channel #VladPCBuild.\nHey there, friends! I\u2019ve finally completed the branded build in collaboration with ASUS and Noctua. It didn\u2019t turn out exactly how I planned since some parts weren\u2019t available, but as usual, it ended up even better! We\u2019ve got ourselves a sleek, perfectly quiet gaming PC.\nThe main goal of this build was to test the combo of the Ryzen 5 9600X processor and the ASUS GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER ProArt OC graphics card. I also went out of my way to find some cool, interesting new components to make this silent PC truly stand out.\nThe foundation of the build is ASUS's new ProArt X870E-Creator WiFi motherboard, paired with the ProArt GPU. For RAM, I\u2019m using a new non-binary kit with 48GB of DDR5 memory \u2014 that\u2019s a 2x24GB/6400 Patriot Viper Xtreme 5 kit (model PVX548G64C32K). To complement the memory, I grabbed a super reliable and stable 4TB M.2 SSD from the same brand \u2014 the Patriot Viper VP4300 Lite (model VP4300L4TBM28H).\nFor cooling, I\u2019m using the next-gen legend \u2014 the Noctua NH-D15 G2 super air tower. To keep everything in one unified style and set up optimal airflow, I\u2019ve added 9 ultra-quiet Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM fans.\nPowering this whole setup is a solid choice in both price and performance \u2014 the Zalman Teramax 2 1000W (ZM1000-TMX2) power supply. And we\u2019re putting it all together in what I think is the best value-for-money case on the market \u2014 the Zalman Z10.\nAs always, I\u2019ll unbox and review all the components, walk you through how to properly assemble a gaming PC, and share some insights along the way. We\u2019ll also be testing it in three resolutions on the most demanding games we all play daily.\nIt\u2019s going to be as interesting and informative as ever, so I highly recommend watching till the end. Thanks for tuning in!",

            "AMD Ryzen 5 7600X (AM5); paired with Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE, Gigabyte Radeon RX 7800 XT (16GB VRAM), G.Skill 32GB DDR5-6000 RAM (2x16), 2TB WD NVMe, all inside an MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WIFI board and Lian Li Lancool 207.",
            "The Lian Li case had little room in the back, so the power cables were a tight fit, and the be quiet! modular PSU came with near egregiously short cables (CPU ones in particular) but they just about fit this ATX mid tower. The ARGB CPU fans had nasty cables imo; they are short, and the ARGB daisy chain takes some space so all I could do was slap them against the top of the case for now. :/",
            "The case also has lots of mesh and (4) intake fans out of the box. My PSU fan points downwards as to draw more air from below and the case exhausts to the rear and top. This build put me back ~$1280 with holiday deals. That is also before any new monitor or accessories.",

            "These are the top 4 things I love about Core Ultra 9 285K:",
            "Runs Super Cool (delid not necessary at all) - 14KS is a hot head, even direct-die on water it doesn't take much to get temps agitated. 285K on the other hand is cool as can be. My rig is literally 99% silent under operation because it consumes a lot less power which translates to nice cool temps. Even during max 4K gaming or full production tasks, my fans/pumps RARELY ramp up. I love it and it's hands-down one of my favorite things about Arrow Lake. Take a peek at the core temps and power draw in my screenshots. With the same hardware and 4K settings, my direct-die cooled 14KS core temps were 20c-30c higher.",
            "Far Lower Power Consumption Than Previous Gen - I'm not a stickler about power, but as mentioned above, the difference is very significant. With 285K I can play the same games I played with 14KS using half the amount of power and side by side I can't tell a difference in gameplay.  You can use just about any cooler you want for this thing and that opens up the door for a lot of options.",
            "CUDIMM Memory At 9000MHz Boots on XMP 2 With Zero Tuning! (***2 Dimms) - I haven't gotten heavy into overclocking ram yet and with CUDIMM on Z890 it looks like I'll never have to because every 8800Mhz kit I've tried can boot 9000Mhz+ XMP 2, with no tuning on this 4 dimm board. I was able to boot 9100MHz, but it wasn't stable, but with zero tuning it's still impressive. I definitely couldn't boot 9000MHz on XMP 2 with my 14KS. I daily drive now with stock XMP 2 settings @ 8800Mhz.",

            "These are the top 4 things I love about Core Ultra 9 285K:",
            "Runs Super Cool (delid not necessary at all) - 14KS is a hot head, even direct-die on water it doesn't take much to get temps agitated. 285K on the other hand is cool as can be. My rig is literally 99% silent under operation because it consumes a lot less power which translates to nice cool temps. Even during max 4K gaming or full production tasks, my fans/pumps RARELY ramp up. I love it and it's hands-down one of my favorite things about Arrow Lake. Take a peek at the core temps and power draw in my screenshots. With the same hardware and 4K settings, my direct-die cooled 14KS core temps were 20c-30c higher.",
            "Far Lower Power Consumption Than Previous Gen - I'm not a stickler about power, but as mentioned above, the difference is very significant. With 285K I can play the same games I played with 14KS using half the amount of power and side by side I can't tell a difference in gameplay.  You can use just about any cooler you want for this thing and that opens up the door for a lot of options.",
            "CUDIMM Memory At 9000MHz Boots on XMP 2 With Zero Tuning! (***2 Dimms) - I haven't gotten heavy into overclocking ram yet and with CUDIMM on Z890 it looks like I'll never have to because every 8800Mhz kit I've tried can boot 9000Mhz+ XMP 2, with no tuning on this 4 dimm board. I was able to boot 9100MHz, but it wasn't stable, but with zero tuning it's still impressive. I definitely couldn't boot 9000MHz on XMP 2 with my 14KS. I daily drive now with stock XMP 2 settings @ 8800Mhz.",

So a couple of weeks later after buying some finishing touches like getting a sleeved cable kit, a diffused RGB strip, and fans that were better performing than before. Much of the increase in performance has been the cpu which was underperforming due to a bad mount of the cooler that wasn't super obvious until I remounted it now it scored very will in cinebench r23 now getting 14,000 vs the 12,000 I was getting before. I get 16,000 in 3dmark time spy if anyone wants that information."

            "Started planning the build over the summer and waited for good deals/bundles to buy. I got the CPU,MOBO,RAM, and SSD from a Newegg bundle, which saved me about $118. Only caveat being that I run the RAM at 6000MHz due to constraints w/ the CPU voltage. I could bump it up a few hundred, but after dealing with a faulty/unstable system for a few years I value stability (plus its not a big difference and still performs great). Overall I spent just over $1200, and I am stoked. I plan on making a benchmark video for fun to showcase. \nThis is the first computer I built, so checking compatibility and assembling it was a bit intimidating but not too bad. Dealing with drivers/windows was annoying. Dont look at the cable managment...",

Finding the correct user manual online was necessary while installing due to some unclear instructions on where to plug some things in (mainly front panel power). Q-Flash was easy and the bios menu is very navigable. Very glad I chose it.",
            "SSD: Fast and easy. Not sure what else to say",
            "GPU: Very cool and quiet! looks great and performs amazing. Nothing can beat its price to performance. Microcenter deal for ~$450 made it even better.",
            "Case: I really like this case and waited a few months for it to go on sale again to buy. Attention to detail is obvious and it looks great. I am currently using the stock intake fans and they seem to get the job done. May switch out in the future. Pretty easy to build in and assemble. Not too big either. Includes a bunch of accessories for management.",

            "Hi there! This is my first PC ever and I built it all by myself, starting with having almost no knowledge on PC building. I'm really satisfied with the results and am confident to say that I'm fairly knowledgeable on PC building now. I cherry-picked each individual parts by myself after watching 48+ hours worth of Youtube videos and 50+ reddit posts within the timespan of 1.5 months. This is probably overkill but I really enjoyed the process and just wanted to make sure that each PC part is exactly what I want. On a side note though, some of the accessories I have were gifts I got from my friends but for the main PC parts, I bought them during Black Friday sales, which saved me a decent amount. The PC building process itself took me around 1 week to complete and this is because I have a pretty severe OCD, I must admit. That said, I'm happy to share the PC I've assembled this year. Would love to hear feedback for any improvements or suggestions. Thanks for stopping by!",

            "This is my upgrade from a 2020 TUF Gaming F15 laptop (i5 10300H [4C/8T] + 1650 Ti [4GB]). I'll add more images later. I only grabbed one to send to my friends. Doesn't show the outside, including the HDD hidden next to the PSU.",
            "The main features of this PC are:\n - i7 10700K [8C/16T]\n - 3070 FE [8GB]\n - 32GB Vengence LPX memory (DDR4, XMP for 3200MHz)\n - 5TB total storage (2TB Samsung NVMe (boot) / 2TB Crucial NVMe \"cold\" storage / 1TB HDD \"super cold\" storage)\n - ASRock B560 PRO4\n - Fractal North mid-tower case (because I'm basic like that)",
            "The motherboard has 3 NVMe slots, but only 2 of them can be used because of the 10th gen CPU. I'll be upgrading to an 11th gen CPU sometime next year, and will get that third NVMe.",
            "Most importantly: This PC cost me $700, only because I bought the GPU, CPU, and motherboard second-hand. The GPU was $333.95, and the CPU and motherboard came together for $217.67 (an epic steal considering how much of an upgrade it is for me). The PSU and case fans were all stolen, with the exception of the front case fans, which came with the case.",
            "I built this PC on the 23rd of November, which was built into another case that I borrowed from my local school. Then I bought the Fractal North on the 24th and transplanted all the internals today. The case arrived yesterday (December 11th).",
            "I haven't played many AAA titles other than Halo Infinite. I'm also playing the Master Chief collection (I found it for $10). Dicking around with the Nvidia settings showed me a \"Fast VSync\" setting, which was not available with my 1650 Ti. This lets me get more than 60 FPS because I'm using cheap monitors with only a 60Hz refresh rate (1080p), so I'd get horrific screen tearing without VSync. This prevents screen tearing.\nAll Halo games prior to Halo Infinite were running with lows of ~180 FPS and highs of ~600 FPS (anniversary editions would get ~200 FPS).\nSubnautica Below Zero also ran with high settings at ~190 FPS.\nFortnite (at least the festival game mode) runs with RTX set to high out of ultra at 80-120 FPS.",
            "Overall, this PC is amazing for me. Love it and do not regret switching to it at all, even if it drained my account."

            "I bought the 14900K as a place holder for something better, but my Best buy doesnt carry any X3d(and I am not a big AMD fan, for personal reasons)  and the ultra 9 was a tad outside my preferred budget.",
            "Both my 13700k and 14900K were not able to run my ram at full speed.  This time I have no issues with XMP.",
            "My monitor is the LG C3 but I cant list it, so I listed the monitor I use when I choose to use this as a tv.",
            "I did repo my gpu out of my old pc, but I will return it once the RTX 5090 is released.  Not doing 5080 as it has same ram amount and I find that a bit meh.  I want more.  Not the same :)",
            "CPU temps are anywhere from 30 to 36 on idle(depends when the heat kicks in on the room)\nand it hit 83c on OCCT test.  Gaming doesnt seem to go over 65c at all, in 4k or 1080p.",
            "I think my 14900K was a lemon, because it was so sluggish, even my rma 13700k was faster.  But this cpu is fast and cool.  My AIO is over kill but I havent used air in nearly 15 years, why start now?  I am testing the pre applied thermal paste, but I bought MX 4 to later swap to.  I may or may not swap the case non rgb fans to rgb, really depends on my mood.",
            "As for the Z890-F  The difference between E and F is the F has 2 less NVME, 5 instead of 7 and 2 less usbs(I think I have like 10? (too tired to go check) and there is no LCD Qcode on the mobo)  Otherwise it is identical for 100 bucks less.",
            "I know people are saying dont buy Arrow lake, but this is no Arrow to the Knee.  And I am enjoying this adventure!!  I legit have no regrets and I was honestly concerned I might.",
            "Most issues people had with games and drivers are windows related.  I did have to reinstall windows with 24h2 update be older windows has issues with EAC and other software and older windows makes you install via onboard gpu that I have yet to test(I turned mine off)",
            "My cpu seems to like to use 4.6GHhz has the standard but will boost to 5.2 as needed I havent overclocked yet as I have no need to.",
            "The OCCT photo isnt even optimized as I have a half dozen tabs open, icue, msi afterburner steam and a few other things I normally close before running.",
            "Not sure why all the outcry.  This was $200 cheaper than me going with a 9800x3d and at 4k I am gpu bound anyway, so I wouldnt likely see any performance gain or loss between the 2.",

            "Reason for build & part selection:\nI had someone bring me their 4th gen Intel i5 build with a GTX 660 asking if there was something I could upgrade to make it keep up with modern titles.  They had specific games they wanted to be able to play and based on the required and recommended specs for them we went with starting fresh.  Went with AM5 so that his upgrade options would be open in the future while they had a budget in the present.  All parts were selected with future improvements in mind, low maintenance, and current requirements exceeded within the budget they gave.  Their original build had LED fans which they found distracting so I ignored RGB for this but didn't outright avoid it as long as it could was addressable.",
            "Build process:\nHaving experience with custom hard tube liquid-cooling, it was a breeze going full air cool.  Having no SATA devices  and basically no RGB also meant minimal cabling required.  Overall, the easiest time I've had building a desktop and I can't say enough good things about the Lancool 207.  The power supply cables for the GPU were like they were made their length with this case in mind and despite reviews saying the cable space in the back of the case being limiting I had no trouble with it.  I will say that using a modular PSU and not needing to manage RGB cables likely helped with this.  The additional corsair fans were fine but while they are daisy chainable, it felt like the connections were always just shy of reaching each other so unless they are being used directly next to each other keep that in mind.  Everything came on first try with zero complications.  I will use this case whenever possible for my next personal build or for others."

            "Did some upgrades to my latest build.",
            "Can see the previous build here: https://pcpartpicker.com/b/YtZZxr",
            "Some cool videos of the side panel:",
            "Mods",
            "Wood in computers has become a signature of my builds. As a hobbyist wood worker, I really enjoy the look as well as a cleaner aesthetic in my home office. Looking more like furniture than a computer. As such, I made a series of different panels to match the theme of the Fractal North XL case. I did my best to try and match the finish of the stock front panel. Its a 10 step process to produce that result. A little bit of stain matching and multiple layers of finish and sanding. Instead of using solid wood panels like I have in the past, I opted to use real walnut veneer adhered to a plexiglass sub-straight. This is a much more stable solution that wont have to contend with normal wood shifting issues. It also significantly reduces the weight and is easier to work with. It also reduces the lumber cost and waste associated with milling custom panels.",
            "For how big the Fractal North is, I was surprised that it didn't accommodate vertical GPU mounting. So I just made my own with a custom bracket to match the rear of the case and give it a more stock look. I used an off the shelf riser cable and made a simple base out of layered acrylic sheets, custom taped to allow the riser to be screwed down. Then I just covered the riser plate with walnut veneer. The bracket secures to the case with small protruding feet and a screw that is taped into the custom rear panel plate.",
            "I used a laser CNC to cut a sheet of acrylic to the right size to fit the rear of the case with the only openings being for the GPU bracket as well as a perfect circle for the 140mm exhaust fan.",
            "Same process as the Rear Panel Plate, but with cutouts for cable pass-through.",
            "Same process as the two above.",
            "I made a custom panel to illuminate the case. In order for the Side Panel mod to work well, I needed a whole lot of light. There is just over 8' of extremely high output LEDs. The strips are high density LEDS 3 per row. I'm not exactly sure how I would measure its output but needless to say I can use the Side Panel mod even with sunlight shining on it. It also has 2 strips of RGB 3mm wide LEDs to offer some color control. Each are powered buy a Shelly RGBW controller that integrates directly with Josh.ai. These are all 12v.",
            "This plate is made up of 3 acrylic sheets cut on a laser CNC. The middle layer has the channels that the fluid will flow through and then that layer is sandwiched by a layer of acrylic. The top sheet had holes cut to the right diameter to allow for quick tapping of G1/4 threads to receive standard water cooling fittings. This mod allowed me to route my tubes in a unique and fun way, minimizing the need for complex fittings and bends.",
            "To tie in the Distro Plate, I made a custom panel with a Josh.ai logo that is backlit with the same 3mm RGB leds. I had very minimal clearance to fit the LEDs along the bottom of the case and had to use 3mm RGB leds. Very tiny requiring some moderate soldering skills. The acrylic backing was sand frosted to allow for better diffusion of the light.",
            "Cut on a laser CNC slightly oversized and then finished with a file and sanding to get it to fit the GPU block perfectly.",
            "I've always enjoyed seeing Snowblind mods. They really add a dynamic feel to a build. However, I've come to learn that execution is pretty tricky for a number of reasons. You either need a lot of light, a lot of contrast (white) or both. Also, every LCD monitor is a little different in terms of its construction, control board and power supply. If you are not familiar with this mod, it entails extracting just the LCD screen from a monitor. Which typically has many different filters and lenses on the back side of the monitor to produce the light required to see the screen. You also need to remove anti glare films if they are applied to the monitor you choose. The monitor I ended up choosing was a Dell P1917S . The screen ratio and size was perfect for this case. The downsides are that it requires 14v to power, its a TN panel making off viewing less ideal, and its control board settings are limited preventing me from being able to flip the screen in menu. I needed to use a step-up converter to convert 12v into 14v, but this allowed me to use the PC power supply instead. To take this mod to the next level, I wanted to figure out a way to re-defuse the light on command to turn the monitor back into a normal monitor with a simple command or flip of a switch. Professionally, I install a product that is used for bathrooms, conference rooms, and schools to turn a window opaque when privacy is needed. Its called Smart Glass. I had an idea to apply this to the back of the LCD screen and I'm happy to say it works beautifully. With a remote or through Josh I can flip the screen from transparent to opaque resulting in a very cool and even useful mod.",
            "Now that I can use the side panel as a monitor or decorative screen, I decided to add an HDMI matrix to the case to allow me to expand its functionality. As I can't easily switch inputs with the monitor and I only have a single HDMI input, this was an obvious choice for me. It also allows me to demonstrate some of the cool features Josh.ai has to offer. This matrix is a 4x2, 4 inputs, 2 outputs. Which allows me to drive the side panel and the attachable portable monitor on the other side of the case for LANs. I have two of the inputs from the GPU itself so that both screens can be used independently, a Roku, and a chromecast. The matrix is an AVPro Edge 4x2 4k matrix with auto scaling. It runs on 5v making it easy to power via the 5v rail on the power supply.",
            "The back side of the case has 12 relays that are powered by 12v. These relays control a 9 button keypad that I can then trigger macros to run on the computer, such as launching games and applications to adjusting the volume. All of these are controlled by a Josh One which is the main processor that runs the Josh.ai system. It also has relays to control the smart glass as well as power for the monitor and computer.",
            "I modded the front panel to accept a Josh.ai Micro. This is a microphone and processor all in one device. For a small Josh system, this is all you would need to get started. I centered the device on the top 140 mm fan and routed its USB-c cable to hide behind the plastic supports of the stock front panel. This is powered by 5v USB-c. There isnt much to this mod. Just some clean cuts and refinishing the newly exposed edges.",
            "Now all the mods that need power I was able to power off of the PC power supply. But unfortunately the Smart Glass needs AC voltage to work, so I added an IEC320 (D Plug) panel mount connector to the back of the case to power the transformer for the smart glass.",
            "This case was a blast to build. I'm excited to integrate it into my office. I also built it for the 2024 Quakecon case modding competition in the Case Mod category. I'm please to say that I took first place in my category and 1st place overall. The competition is run and sponsored by Nvidia Geforce Garage and they'll be flying me out to California to do an exclusive on the case. When that is done I'll post the video link here!",
            "I hope you enjoy the build and if you have any questions please let me know in the comments."

I was going to wait for the next generation of GPUs to come out, but unfortunately my laptop decided that now was the perfect time to stop working...",
            "This system runs amazingly well. It's a massive upgrade, easily 10x better than my old laptop. The CPU/GPU combo is a beast at 1440p. The Noctua fans are impressively quiet at 500-1000 RPM while moving lots of air. I would recommend every component in this build.",
            "Notes:",
            "I didn't fully understand how big GPUs could be until I handled one in person. Like wow, this thing is l o n g. Maybe one of the only things I regret is vertically mounting this card since it shortened the clearance significantly. I was expecting a good amount of space between the GPU and the case front but nope. It goes right up against the fans. Expect the GPU to lengthen like 15-20mm when installing a vertical mount. Surprisingly though, I saw a 1-2C decrease in thermals. But that depends on the case.",
            "The Arctic Freezer III is fairly big for an AIO. The radiator is thick (38mm compared to the standard 27mm), and the tubes are also long and stiff. It's safe to stay this won't fit in SFF cases. The performance is some of the best though, especially on AM5.\nI will say, mounting this was a pain. I struggled for a few minutes trying to hold the pump in place on the CPU while I screwed it in. There's definitely easier mounting systems out there.",

            "This PC is used for office work and occasional 1080 gaming, the budget was limited so the GPU was bought second hand (if buying new in 2024 I would recommend RTX 4060 instead - similar card but uses less power). I do not like RGB lights so I was trying to choose parts without LED. Overall I believe this build is well balanced:\nCPU is an inexpensive 4 core processor from Intel, used in many other budget builds.\nMy CPU cooler is ID-Cooling SE-214-XT in black, which is more than enough for 65W processor.\nThe mother board is MSI Pro H610m-G (it has M.2 KeyE WiFi module and aRGB unlike H610m-E). Unfortunately, this MB has only one SysFan 4-pin connector, so I had to use a daisy-chain of Arctic F12 PWM PST case fans from my old PC (the MSI MAG Forge 100R case comes with 3 installed fans with 3-pin connectors).\nOtherwise I think this MB is more than enough for such a low power CPU as i3 12100.\nI bought 2 x 8 GB DDR4-3600 RAM, even though the H610 motherboards support only up to 3200, because the price was the same between them two. \nPatriot P300 storage was the cheapest and seems to be a very good value indeed.\nThe GPU stays cool in gaming and there is no coil whine or fan noise. However, as I said earlier, I would prefer RTX 4060 8Gb instead as it takes less power and is more modern.\nThe PSU is also MSI and provides 550W, which is more than enough for this build.\nI chose this case because it just looks nice (personal preference) and there was a good Black Friday discount when I purchased it. It has plenty of space for all the components and offers excellent ventilation even with 3 fans (2 in front + 1 rear fan). \nOverall, I believe this to be probably the best low budget build in 2024, which should be enough for 1080 gaming and basic work/study for another 4-5 years, although I understand that these components do not allow any future upgrades."

            "My first mITX and the appeal of reasonable portability were motivators for this build.",

            "It\u2019s been 8 years since my last build. Ideally I\u2019d like this build to be able to perform better than the current generation of consoles (e.g. Xbox Series X, PS5 Pro, etc.) and reasonably keep pace with the next generation. Of course there\u2019s so many variables to this so I look at this as a generally in the ballpark kind of requirement (e.g. it doesn't have to blow the current generation out of the water, but it shouldn't be struggling in comparison). Part of my reasoning is cost vs. general expectations of performance. The other part is being able to play the games I want to play in the future with reasonable performance. For me, reasonable performance is around 60fps at 1440p while bumping up to 4K whenever possible. I'm flexible on graphics quality settings as long as my setup continues to clear the minimum requirements. Assuming my gaming habits roughly remain the same, I anticipate it\u2019ll last me just as long, if not longer, than my previous build.",

            "Games I continuously return to and play: Rocket League, Civilization 6, Overwatch 2, Stardew Valley, Celeste",
            "Favorite games ever across all platforms: FFVI, Persona 5, Mario Kart 8, Stardew Valley, Hades",
            "Unreleased PC games at the time of build I\u2019m definitely going to play: FF7 Remake 2 and 3, Hades 2, Civilization 7, Subnautica 2, Forza Horizon 6, Persona 6",
            "Miscellany Notes",
            "Parts procured from Micro Center, Newegg, B&H, Best Buy and Amazon.",
            "As part of the build, I subbed in a Noctua thermal compound and fan for the ones that came with the Thermalright cooler. This was my way of wanting to support Noctua because of their work in documenting the support matrix of their low profile coolers to the AM5 processors which I thoroughly found helpful."

So fast forward 2024, my PC died 3 years ago (yes, it lasted a year) and I have been using a laptop since 2021 and because I am about to turn 19 I decided to splash some money after tediously saving since July and I needed to satisfy my needs.",

Upping ram voltages to 1.4 has fixed it. 13600kf runs 1.3 vcore overclocked to 5.6p4.3e4.9 ring 181 watts and 81 Celsius on OCCT stress test. The z690 taichi razer for 170 is probably my favorite part. It's a beautiful board."

The finished product looks better without any rgb so I do wish I had gotten the aio that doesn't have any rgb, but other than that I'm pretty happy with what I made. I will probably start make a parts list for a pc that I might get in the future if I'm still interested in getting a better one that looks exactly what I want it to look like."

            "Just upgraded my gpu from rx6600 to 3080ti. Went from 16gb to 32gb. New psu. Planning on getting a new MoBo and threaded cleaner cables. I wanted to upgrade because I found out that my moniter has a 4k resolution option and I wanted to utilize it since the rx 6600 cannot handle 4k. I traded my old laptop for the 3080ti and I've gotta say the performance difference is insane. I'm getting double the amount of frames I would in 1080p and 1440p in every game and Can actually play games in 4k above 40fps. Cyberpunk runs at an average of 45fps 4k max settings ray tracing yatayata. I'll probably make a new post when I get the new cables if anyone has recommendation to which cables I should get please let me know."

            "Everything came together pretty well. I left Antec case fans where they were, and if I had it to do over again, I would move the bottom fans as they made it very difficult to get my meaty mitts in there to connect that dadgum USB2 connector. I over-applied thermal paste, but that's a messy thing rather than a problem-causer. I can't argue with the temps I'm getting. Overall, it was a smooth build for my first go-round, and I am delighted with the outcome.",
            "I have found the MSI B650's onboard Bluetooth is a bit janky. The mouse and Xbox controller connected slowly but stayed connected (yay!). Speakers may or may not connect; if they connect, they may not stay connected, and while connected, they put out no sound from the system. I have used a speaker connected via AUX jack, but the speaker is old and not the best. I have a USB soundbar on order. I am contemplating getting a Bluetooth adapter and disabling integrated Bluetooth. This is the ONLY gripe I've had with any of the parts I have used.",
            "I am pretty pleased with myself for my completely amateur job in cable management. It's not the best, but it's not the complete nightmare I'd've expected from myself (who is fond of half-assing it).",
            "UPDATE: I added a UGREEN Bluetooth adapter that has fixed the Bluetooth issues I was having. Further, I wasn't delighted with where I had to place the GPU support bracket I'd originally purchased and used. So I picked up another that is meant to brace itself against a fan structure better."

            "Spent some genuine money and sold old parts and used Christmas to leverage this upgrade. At the end I spent 900 aud out of my pocket for this pc. This build will most certainly last me 4 years and I'm happy with its performance. Temps for the 7800x3d are a bit high on idle. I repasted as the thermal paste with the cooler was hitting 80 when loading stuff. I put a thick layer of it on and now I haven't seen it hit 80 ever since and I've noticed much cooler idle temps. The 4070tis is actually so big that I struggled to get it into the Case. By the time I will need a new gpu I'll need a fridge for a case!"

            "Wanting to build a computer for productivity and gaming, I began to look for the right parts for my build. I decided to go fully Team Red (AMD). Everything I purchased, I did my best to get while it was on sale, or at a discount. Special thanks to Microcenter!!!",
            "I fell in love with the jade Terra the moment I laid eyes on it, and knew that that was going to be the case for the build , even though SFF cases are challenging, and especially so for a first timer.",
            "Initially choosing the blazing hot 7700X, I opted instead for the 9700X because I got a good deal on it from AliExpress (thank you SZCPU!), it is newer, and runs much cooler than the 7700X with 5%-10% more performance (more efficient).",
            "I chose the ASUS ROG B650E-I because of the features it offers, as well as its aesthetic. The first one I purchased started to give me a persistent DRAM QLED, after which I had to exchange it for another one and I haven't had an issue since.",
            "I'm happy with the Teamgroup T-Create Expert low latency RAM I have chosen and use AMD EXPO to OC to its advertised 6000mhz speed. I think the sticks look really sexy and fit the overall aesthetic, too. The RAM is low profile and has no RGB which are both pluses for me.",
            "I chose the Thermalright AXP120-X67 CPU cooler because a YouTube experiment showed that it is highly effective at cooling and has slightly better cooling capacity than its competitors, while being at a generally low cost. I'm happy with the quality and performance of the cooler, though I think it would be nicer to change out the fan with a slim one that is quieter. The cooler is kind of large and it makes the fan sit quite close to the side panel of the Terra.",
            "With regards to storage I think I could have gone cheaper. A part of me also wonders if I should have upgraded to the 990 PRO instead, but I remind myself that the gains in speed are probably not worth it anyways. Overall, I'm happy with the SSD that I have chosen. I'm considering buying another just to store games.",
            "I initially purchased a Corsair SF750 PSU, but after seeing that the SF1000 wasn't too far off in terms of price and offered massive future-proofing, I ended up going for that.",
            "Last but not least, I chose the Gigabyte RX7800 XT OC with 16GB VRAM because I found a killer deal on a new one for only $300 (thank you Shannon!). The 7800 XT was #2 on my priority list, second only to the 7900 GRE. However, there seems to a shortage of that GPU around me, and the ones that are being sold are easily +$500. As you can see, I believe I made the best possible deal here.",
            "All in all, I had a blast putting it all together from start to finish. Turns out that I not only love using PCs, but I love building them too! I use mine for my education, work, gaming, and leisure. It serves me very well, without everything being near instantaneous. Truly, what a beast I've had the privilege of putting together! It even games at 4K with a constant 60 FPS on BF2042 and 40 FPS on Cyberpunk 2077! I know I can optimize it further for higher frame rates, and I look forward to doing that. The case fan is installed below the PSU at the bottom, in exhaust orientation. It does a great job of venting out warm air from inside the case.",
            "In the future I plan on making a bracket out of 6mm aluminum sheet to serve as a pass-through for water lines. That's right, I'm gonna water cool the CPU and GPU with a double external radiator setup in the near future!",
            "Definitely going for a custom loop, and looking forward to having a giant dual push-pull radiator setup on my desk. I'd also eliminate all fans from the PC case itself so that it stays as quiet as possible during use.",
            "I hope you enjoyed reading about my journey, and leave me some comments with your thoughts. How do you like this build? What would you have done differently? Got any good ideas? Let em rip!"
